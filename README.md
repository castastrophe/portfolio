:wave: I am a passionate front-end architect & technical lead at Red Hat on the User Experience, Digital Marketing team, where we build the design system that powers many of Red Hat's marketing web assets.

Nothing makes me happier than exploring new technologies and implementing highly-optimized, clean solutions to complex problems.
