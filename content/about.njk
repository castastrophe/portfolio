    <p>I am a passionate front-end architect with a proven expertise in building massively scalable design systems. What allows them to rapidly scale? The super-power of any codified design system is a thriving open and/or inner source community that feels engaged and empowered.</p>
    
    <p><b class="extra">Nothing makes me happier than exploring new technologies and implementing highly-optimized, clean solutions to complex problems.</b></p>
    <p>Developer experience and accessibility are deeply important to me and these values guide the code I produce and influence. One of the most enjoyable aspects
        of my work is community management; engaging with and connecting contributors to how they can best solve the problems they face.</p>
