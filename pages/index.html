                    design systems and their associated tooling to serve designers, developers, content writers, and users alike. <b>My most
                        valuable tool in this endeavor has always been active listening.</b> I ask a lot of questions
                    and work hard to understand what we're really trying to solve, for the business and for the user.
                    Making tools that are fun and easy for developers is important to me and hopefully makes what I
                    build an obvious choice over the option to "reinvent the wheel". If I do my job right, I let
                    developers and designers work on cutting-edge work instead of having to construct the building
                    blocks from stratch.</p>

                                    <dd>This position changed the course of my career. After completing a summer
                                        internship, I accepted a full-time position with this group; pausing my progress
                                        on an English degree from NC State for a chance to get real professional
                                        experience. Instead, what I learned was that publishing is 80% project
                                        management and only 20% actual editing; more than that, I enjoyed it! When the
                                        group rolled out a new software for tracking publications, I threw myself into
                                        detailed product testing and realized my love of computers could be a career.
                                        That led me back to college at Meredith to complete a Bachelors of Science in
                                        Computer Science by 2012. <a class="read-more">Read more.</a></dd>

                                    <dd>This position changed the course of my career. After completing a summer
                                        internship, I accepted a full-time position with this group; pausing my progress
                                        on an English degree from NC State for a chance to get real professional
                                        experience. Instead, what I learned was that publishing is 80% project
                                        management and only 20% actual editing; more than that, I enjoyed it! When the
                                        group rolled out a new software for tracking publications, I threw myself into
                                        detailed product testing and realized my love of computers could be a career.
                                        That led me back to college at Meredith to complete a Bachelors of Science in
                                        Computer Science by 2012. <a class="read-more">Read more.</a></dd>
