<h2 slot="pfe-band--header" class="header-title">Experience & passion</h2>
<p slot="pfe-band--header" class="header-summary">I've spent 7+ years at Red Hat investing in building
    design systems that work for designers, developers, content writers, and users alike. <b>My most
        valuable tool in this endeavor has always been active listening.</b> I ask a lot of questions
    and work hard to understand what we're really trying to solve, for the business and for the user.
    Making tools that are fun and easy for developers is important to me and hopefully makes what I
    build an obvious choice over the option to "reinvent the wheel". If I do my job right, I let
    developers and designers work on cutting-edge work instead of having to construct the building
    blocks from stratch.</p>

                    <dd>This position changed the course of my career. After completing a summer
                        internship, I accepted a full-time position with this group; pausing my progress
                        on an English degree from NC State for a chance to get real professional
                        experience. Instead, what I learned was that publishing is 80% project
                        management and only 20% actual editing; more than that, I enjoyed it! When the
                        group rolled out a new software for tracking publications, I threw myself into
                        detailed product testing and realized my love of computers could be a career.
                        That led me back to college at Meredith to complete a Bachelors of Science in
                        Computer Science by 2012. <a class="read-more">Read more.</a></dd>

                    <dd>This position changed the course of my career. After completing a summer
                        internship, I accepted a full-time position with this group; pausing my progress
                        on an English degree from NC State for a chance to get real professional
                        experience. Instead, what I learned was that publishing is 80% project
                        management and only 20% actual editing; more than that, I enjoyed it! When the
                        group rolled out a new software for tracking publications, I threw myself into
                        detailed product testing and realized my love of computers could be a career.
                        That led me back to college at Meredith to complete a Bachelors of Science in
                        Computer Science by 2012. <a class="read-more">Read more.</a></dd>

                <p>I wrote this plugin because the existing include plugins for Gulp didn't have
                    quite the flexibility I wanted in the formatting of the include statements.
                    Especially helpful if you have an existing library that already has it's own
                    include syntax.</p>

<p slot="pfe-band--header" class="header-summary">I've moved away from full-page design in the last few years to focus on systems architecture. When I was involved in these design projects though, I loved working with stakeholders to get at the heart of what they needed from their page; asking the right questions to get to the real problem and make something of which we both could be proud.</p>
